        <h2 class="hedory">Our History</h2>
		<p>The current Red Bull team traces its origins back to the Stewart Grand Prix outfit that made its debut in 1997. Jackie Stewart sold his team to the Ford Motor Company late in 1999, and Ford made the decision to rebrand the team Jaguar Racing with little subsequent success over the next five years. </p> </br>
		<p>The Jaguar Racing Formula One constructor and racing team was put up for sale in September 2004 when Ford decided it could "no longer make a compelling business case for any of its brands to compete in Formula One."[14] Red Bull, an energy drinks company, agreed its purchase of Jaguar Racing on the final 
			day of the sale, 15 November 2004.[15] BBC Sport reported that Ford asked bidders for a symbolic US$1 in return for a commitment to invest US$400 million in the team over three Grand Prix seasons.[15] The team continued to have access to the Cosworth engine developed for their 2005 chassis, and the operation
			continued under the new title. Christian Horner was installed as the new team boss and lined up David Coulthard and Christian Klien to drive for the team. The team operated under a British racing licence from 2005 to 2006.[16] Red Bull Racing was not the start of Red Bull's involvement in Formula One, as they 
			sponsored Sauber from 1995 to 2004. After buying a Formula One team of its own, Red Bull ended its long-term partnership with the Swiss team. Red Bull also runs a young drivers programme, Red Bull Junior Team, whereby Red Bull sponsors promising young drivers. High-profile drivers who have received this
			backing include Enrique Bernoldi, Christian Klien, Patrick Friesacher, Vitantonio Liuzzi and Scott Speed. Red Bull also sponsors many drivers and teams competing in the Formula 2 Championship, Formula One's "feeder" series. </p>

		<h2>Our Mission</h2>
		<img src="./resource/fouunder.jpg" alt="rB-founder">
		<p>Born from Red Bull founder Dietrich Mateschitzs desire to disrupt the status quo in F1 and to bring back the swashbuckling spirit of grand prix racings golden age, the Team established itself as a maverick force that played hard off track but worked even harder on it. And with Christian Horner as the sports youngest team principal, Red Bull Racing made an immediate impression.

			On its debut at the 2005 Australian Grand Prix, the Team scored a double points finish, with David Coulthard finishing fourth and rookie Christian Klien crossing the line in seventh place.
			
			The Team went on to finish comfortably mid-table in both 2005 and the following year scored its first podium finish, with Coulthard driving the RB2 to third place at the Monaco Grand Prix.
			
			For 2007, Mark Webber came onboard to join DC and at the European Grand Prix, the Australian scored his first podium finish with the team. His third place at the Nürburging helped the team to fifth place in the Constructors standings. The following year saw the Team slide to seventh overall but 2009 brought a major shift in the regulations and the Teams fortunes.
			
			David Coulthard retired at the end of 2008 to be replaced by Sebastian Vettel. Sebs arrival coincided with a major reset in the sports aerodynamic regulations. The new rules gave the technical team the chance to shine and with the RB5, they produced a winner: Vettel took Red Bull Racings first victory, leading home Webber in a 1-2 finish at the Chinese Grand Prix. The car would win five more times in 2009, including Webbers debut F1 victory at the Nürburgring. The team finished second in the Constructors Championship but, perhaps more significantly, it won the final three races of the season.
			
			History was made in 2010. Driving the RB6, Webber and Vettel were title contenders from the start. Their consistent podium finishes secured the Constructors Championship at the penultimate round in Brazil. Both drivers went to the final race in Abu Dhabi with a shot at the Drivers crown. Vettel emerged triumphant, winning the race to become the sports youngest ever World Champion. A record that still stands.
			
			The RB7 and Vettel dominated 2011. The German driver took 11 of the teams dozen victories and won his second Drivers title with four races to spare. The Constructors title was confirmed with three races remaining. </p>
